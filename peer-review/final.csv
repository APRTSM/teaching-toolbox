In the beginning of the semester, I had invited everyone to a call to explain the basics of Web Development (what is the web, HTTP, etc..) in order to give them a jump-start to their learning experience, Ege seemed to be cooperative up until then.

But even then, Ege showed little-to-no interest in contributing to the project. I had observed that he was trying to simply use LLMs to perform his job, and when the LLM fails to do so, pushes his code and expects me to do something about it. Extremely unprofessional. He was able to complete one feature's frontend without much of my help (the schedule page, where guides mark their own schedule).

But other than this, I do not have anything to add., Bilgehan has shown little-to-no effort to even respond to attemps of communicating with him, claiming he only used Discord as a communication media, noting that it is banned in Turkey. He also consistently pushed code that did not work, had major style issues, and did not follow any instructions provided by me or other teammates, resulting in multiple people working on the same thing due to his carelessness. He rarely listens to the plans given, usually doing whatever he feels like doing, hindering everyones' progress. He keeps following bad Git practices, making extra work on me to re-organize everything. He has shown zero effort at making something that is presentable. He worked on 2 features' frontend at max, and I had to re-work those due to violating code re-use principles and providing terrible UI designs, mostly outputs of ChatGPT with no testing at all!

We had divided most of the work around middle of semester. Her first push was 13th of December. She was only supposed to add fairs which is similar to tours. The code was not well written and had many bugs which weren't solved later on. The only other pushes she did were minor visual changes like adding background images. She attended to most (not all) meetings and mostly was not on time. She also wasn't doing much work for the deliverables anyway. I can understand if you can't attend or do work for a week or two, but doing this for the whole semester shows you are unresponsible and a bad teammate. In the last weeks of the project, she messaged me saying she couldn't start the project (genuinely couldn't open the project) and asked for the commands and explain what was wrong. She hadn't downloaded the dependencies. We decided on these in the first weeks and this was probably the first time she OPENED the project. She was genuinely a freeloader. I don't think she has the necessary skill required to get a passing grade. She definitely shouldn't be graded the same as my other teammates. This was a very sorry performance on her part, I wish her future teammates much luck on doing work with her. Just inadequate., The work she did was only 5% of the implementation. She was responsible for the fair related pages. She has total of 6 commits, 5 of them being was just adding background images to the login and home page. Her other 1 commit was the frontend and backend for fairs. At this point the tour related pages were already implemented and all she had to do was copy paste the tour backend and frontend and change the variables and names to represent the fairs. She claimed she finished her part and pushed her code. The code she pushed wasn't working, it literally crashed the backend and she just posted it without telling us there was a problem. When I said the problem was caused by the fairs she didn't even send a message back. Her next message is 3 days later. Communication with her is also generally hard. She doesn't look at her messages in a timely manner.  The week before the presentations Koray had to be hospitalized and couldn't help within the last days of the projects (there were 3 days until the release) and she still didn't even bother to ask if there was anything that needed to be done. Lastly, before the day of our presentation we decided to stay after school and to prepare for the presentation. Convienently, she messages the group 1 hour before the meeting and says she is suddenly not feeling good. It might have been true but like cmon. I know she needs to take the bus and the subway to get to school she probably just didn't want to come. In the actual presentation, we were only 3 people since Koray was still in the hospital. In the 13-14 minutes of presentation we did her part was only at maximum 2 minutes, because she basically did nothing. Overall she was in the mood of ""I'll just do the bare minimum"" .                                                                                         TL;DR hard to comminucate, didn't do much work and made us a basically a 3 person group                      ",,,,,75,22101646,dilara-yilmaz,,,10,90,30,101,54,54,44,75,,,

He did every task we divided and more. Did not once ask for help from anyone and figured things out. Offered to help out if we weren't able to finish something in time and was overall very supportive and easy-going. I think he did a perfect job as a teammate. Last week he got appendicitis so he wasn't able to contribute that last weekend but he did more than enough during the whole semester.,,33,"38,175",3791,75,22202548,koraySevil,,,,,,,,,,75,,,

His frontend responsibility was to deliver a base as a sketch and that was pretty much it, however the work he has delivered was out of the boundaries for the project descriptions and were missing functions.
